        <h2>San Sancha Sangenjaya</h2>

        <p>Tea. Ocha. A staple and cultural icon of Japan. Sangenjaya, or Sancha as it is colloquially known, isn’t all that different from tea. Much like tea, Sancha has its place in Japanese history, but now finds itself side-by-side with newer traditions.</p>

        <p>Sangenjaya, a district in Southern Tokyo’s Setagaya Ward has transformed from an Edo period village to a modern day hotspot, desired and visited by foreigners and locals alike. Sancha, at one point was known for three distinct tea houses (hence the name) where Sangenjaya Station and regrettably, a McDonald’s are now located. Despite the transition from tea to burgers, it is now one of Tokyo’s hottest hubs, containing cafes, restaurants, izakayas, universities, parks and endless opportunities for those looking to find picturesque Tokyo alleyways and a sprawling metropolis.</p>

        <p>So what can you do if you find yourself in Sancha?</p>

        <p>In case you were more curious about the origin of the name Sangenjaya (three tea houses), here it is. Sangenjaya or 三軒茶屋 contains four kanji, or Japanese symbolic characters. San is the number three and is represented by the kanji (三). Gen (軒) is  a counter for houses or buildings. So far, if you put 三軒 together, we have “three houses”. Ja, or (茶) means tea, and Ya (屋) means store or shop. Put all of the kanji together and we get 三軒茶屋.</p>
