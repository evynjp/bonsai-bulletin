        <h1>About Evyn</h1>
        
        <p>Hello! I'm Evyn. This is my photo-journalism blog. I am from Los Angeles, California but have been living in Tokyo, Japan since early 2022.</p>
        
        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>For now, let us just start after my high school graduation which was May of 2010.</p>
            <p>Shortly after graduating high school, I joined the United States Army as an infantryman and found myself fighting for my life every day in Southern Afghanistan's Kandahar Province. I was in the Arghandab River Valley, one of the country's most dangerous areas. In my year in Afghanistan, I was wounded by an improvised explosive device (IED) at only 18 years old, saw many friends hurt or worse (you can guess for yourself what this means), tons of gunfighting, and tons of downtime contemplating my position. However, this experience taught me many things such as perseverance, my capability for handling physical and mental barriers, empathy, and list of other things too long for this section.</p>
            <p>I spent three and a half years in the military and decided that my stint in the armed forces was over</p>

        <h2>Goals For This Blog</h2>
            <p>As mentioned above, I have a decent amount of life experience, have had a variety of jobs, leading to many different interests and skills. My goal with this blog is to use some of my experiences and learned skills to build and run this photo-journalistic blog. As my knowledge and skills improve, I expect that this website and blog will as well.</p>
