        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>Hello! I'm Evyn. This is my photo-journalism blog. I am from Los Angeles, California but have been living in Tokyo, Japan since early 2022.</p>
        
        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

            <p>Lets just start after my high school graduation which was in May of 2010.</p>

            <p>Shortly after graduating high school, I joined the United States Army as an infantryman and found myself fighting for my life every day in Southern Afghanistan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Province" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kandahar Province</a>. I was in a village called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singesar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sangsar</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhari_District" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zhari District</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arghandab_District,_Kandahar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Arghandab River Valley</a>, one of the country's most dangerous areas. Sangsar was the "homeland" of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taliban</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullah_Omar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mullah Omar</a>, who founded the Taliban in the village. During my year in Afghanistan, I was wounded by an improvised explosive device (IED) at only 18 years old, saw many friends get hurt, or worse (you can guess for yourself what this means), tons of gunfighting, and tons of downtime where I was able to contemplate my mortality and position in this universe. However, this experience taught me many things such as perseverance, my capability for handling physical and mental barriers, empathy, and list of other things too long for this section. I spent three and a half years in the military and decided that my stint in the armed forces was over, making the transition to higher education.</p>

            <p>Upon leaving the army I had a couple options. I had applied to a few universities just prior to my discharge but decided to attend Penn State University's nursing program. That plan did not last long as upon returning back home to Los Angeles I realized that I had missed my city, my home, my friends, and my family too much. I spent the next few years switching majors, continuously failing community college, dropping out of film school, and overall being unable to figure out what I wanted to do, let alone do it right.</p>

            <p>Then my 25th birthday came. I was tired of failure, tired of my lack of vision, vision for my future, vision for success. Despite my previous hurdles, my bad back and knees, and a host of other issues, both physical and mental. I got it together. Time started flying after my 25th birthday. I finally started to take school seriously, graduated community college with two associate degrees, graduated with my bachelor's degree in journalism and public relations, became an EMT during the COVID-19 pandemic, then made the ultimate life-changing decision to leave everything I knew and loved, and moved to Tokyo, Japan.</p>

            <p>My life in Tokyo is different from my life in Los Angeles in many ways, but similar in others. I went to a Japanese language school for two years, became an English teacher (as many foreigners do), roamed the streets and alleyways with a camera chasing picturesque results. Now, I still do some of those things, but my life in many ways has become simpler. I am now a graduate student studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_linguistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">applied linguistics</a> and in June of 2025 I started my programming journey, albeit a bit late.</p>

            <p>This blog is a culmination and continuance of my life experiences, skills, knowledge, attained and yet to be mastered or learned.</p>

        <h2>Goals For This Blog</h2>

            <p>As mentioned above, I have a decent amount of life experience, have had a variety of jobs, leading to many different interests and skills. My goal with this blog is to use some of my experiences and learned skills to build and run this photo-journalistic blog. As my knowledge and skills improve, I expect that this website and blog will as well.</p>
